# Pack Men

## Description
A web app that generates Pac Men with the press of the "Add PacMen" button. By pressing the "Start Game" button, the Pac Men are set moving in a random direction with a random speed, and will bounce off the edges of the screen.

### Things I learned in this project:
- Adding elements and storying them to a page dynamically.
- Edge detection for animation to make the Pac Men reverse direction when they hit an edge.

## How to Run
To run this project simply open the index.html file.

## Future Improvements
- Make the Pac Men bounce off eachother
- Make a more appealing layout with an outlined box for the game and add a title banner.
